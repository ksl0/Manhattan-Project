<p>The issue of grade distribution has come to the forefront of the Pomona College faculty discourse in the last two weeks. Michael Steinberger, associate professor of economics and chair of the curriculum committee, said that the committee is currently looking at grade distribution and trying to find a way to address the perceived increase in Pomona students&rsquo; grades.</p>

<p>Claremont McKenna consistently had the highest or nearly the highest percentage of A&#39;s given per school year among 23 peer institutions, according to Pomona&rsquo;s 2011 accreditation report. The percentage of A&#39;s rose from 32.9 percent in the 1981-1982 school year to 59.7 percent in 2009-2010.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To address the issue, the committee has put forth the idea of requiring professors to provide explanations for why they give high proportions of A&rsquo;s. The committee presented this proposal during the March 4 faculty meeting.</p>

<p>According to the motion, professors would need to fill out a form providing reasons for any A pluses they give to students. They would also be required to provide an explanation if they give more than 50 percent of students in their class A&rsquo;s. This information would then be sent to department chairs and the Dean of the College for consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the motion was tabled to be discussed during the committee&#39;s next meeting in April. According to Steinberger, this was because many faculty were unhappy with the present proposal.</p>
